          called Naawi Oodena which is Anishinaabe and in English means centre of the heart and community. The land is 160 acres and they have
          this land do to land agreements set in Treaty 1. Indigenous people were short on the land they where supposed to get, so if there was
          crown land that they were going to sell, the Indigenous people would get to say it they wanted to buy it or not first. At first, the
          goverment was going to sell it to a company, that would've disregarded Treaty 1.
