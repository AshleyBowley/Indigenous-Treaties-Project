            Kapyong Barracks has been sold to Indigenous people, they are going to start to make a shopping area and more. This area will be
            called Naawi Oodena which is is Anishinaabe and in English means centre of the heart and community. The land is 160 acres they have
            this land do to land agreements set in Treaty 1. Indigenous people were short on the land they where supposed to get, so if there
            is goverment land that they are going to sell, the Indigenous people would get to say it they wanted to buy it or not. At first,
            the goverment was going to sell it to a company, that disregards Treaty 1.
