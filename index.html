            <span>Treaty 1</span> was signed August 1,1871. It was signed in Lower Fort Garry, which is located in St. Andrews, Manitoba.
            <span>Treaty 1</span> was the first Treaty that was signed that helped establish Canada as the country we know today. The
            Indigenous people had been living on the land for thousands of years, then Europeans came. Indigenous people had to find a way to
            live with the European settlers. Their way to live in peace with Europeans was to sign Treaties to help establish boundaries with
            the Europeans about what land they could build on and take materals from.
